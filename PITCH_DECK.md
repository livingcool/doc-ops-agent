## Slide 2: The Problem

### Documentation is always outdated.

In modern software development, speed is everything. But this creates a huge problem:

*   **It's Tedious:** Writing and updating documentation is a manual, time-consuming chore that developers often skip.
*   **It Creates Debt:** This leads to "documentation debt," where the codebase and the docs drift apart, making the code hard to understand and maintain.
*   **Knowledge Gets Lost:** When documentation is stale, onboarding new engineers is slow, and valuable knowledge is siloed with individual developers.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### Meet DocSmith: Your AI Teammate.

DocSmith is an autonomous AI agent that joins your development team with one mission: **to keep your documentation perfectly in sync with your code.**

It works just like a human engineer:

1.  It **watches** the repository for new code changes.
2.  It **analyzes** the impact of those changes.
3.  It **writes** clear, accurate documentation.
4.  It **submits** its work for review by creating a pull request.

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

### An Intelligent, Automated Workflow

DocSmith uses a sophisticated, multi-step process to ensure high-quality results.

1.  **Listen & Analyze:** A GitHub webhook triggers the agent on a `push` or `pull_request` merge. The agent's first AI chain analyzes the code diff to determine if the change is functional or trivial.
2.  **Retrieve & Decide:** For functional changes, the agent searches its vector memory (FAISS) for existing docs. Based on a confidence score, it decides whether to **Update** existing content or **Create** something new.
3.  **Generate:** A specialized AI chain (`Rewriter` or `Creator`) generates the new documentation in clean Markdown.
4.  **Learn & Act:** The agent updates its own central `Knowledge_Base.md` file with what it just wrote—**allowing it to learn from its work**. Finally, it creates a new pull request on GitHub.

## Slide 5: Key Innovation

### The Self-Improving Knowledge Loop

The most powerful feature of DocSmith is its ability to learn.

*   **Traditional RAG is Static:** Most RAG systems query a fixed knowledge base.
*   **DocSmith is Dynamic:** When DocSmith generates new documentation, it feeds that knowledge **back into its own vector store**.

This creates a virtuous cycle: the more documentation it writes, the more context it has, and the smarter and more accurate its future documentation becomes.

## Slide 6: Technical Architecture

### Built on a Modern, Scalable Stack

*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Gunicorn
*   **AI/LLM:** LangChain, Google Gemini, FAISS Vector Store
*   **Frontend:** React, Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time logs
*   **DevOps:** GitHub Webhooks, Render (Backend), Vercel (Frontend)

---

## Slide 7: Live Demo

### Transparency and Trust

*(This is where you would show a screenshot or a live demo of the frontend)*

*   The frontend provides a **real-time log stream** of the agent's thoughts and actions.
*   Users can watch as the agent analyzes code, makes decisions, and generates documentation.
*   This transparency builds trust and makes it easy to see exactly what the agent is doing.

## Slide 8: Use Cases & Impact

### Who is this for?

*   **Rapidly Growing Startups:** Keep docs in sync with a fast-moving product to accelerate onboarding.
*   **Open Source Projects:** Reduce maintainer burnout and make it easier for new contributors to get started.
*   **Large Enterprise Teams:** Ensure consistency and knowledge sharing across complex, multi-team projects.

**The Impact:** Eliminate documentation debt, preserve institutional knowledge, and free up developers to do what they do best: build.

---

## Slide 9: Future Roadmap

*   **Interactive Feedback:** Allow users to approve/reject PRs, providing feedback that the agent uses to fine-tune its models.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** Extend beyond Markdown to support generating documentation in Confluence, Notion, or other platforms.
*   **Deeper Code Analysis:** Generate full API specifications (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) directly from code.
